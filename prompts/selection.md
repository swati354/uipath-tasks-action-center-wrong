# Template Selection

UiPath-specific React dashboard with uipath-sdk SDK pre-configured.

**Use for:** UiPath/RPA automation dashboards, Orchestrator monitoring, process/queue/task management, Action Center portals, Maestro orchestration, robot fleet monitoring.

**Avoid for:** Non-automation apps, no UiPath integration needed, static sites.

**Includes:** Pre-configured UiPath SDK client, React Query hooks for all UiPath services (processes, queues, tasks, robots, assets, Maestro), ready-to-use UI components (ProcessCard, QueueMonitor, TaskCard, JobStatusBadge), hardcoded authentication, real-time polling, UiPath branding.

**⚠️ CRITICAL: This template uses REAL data from UiPath SDK - NEVER create mock/dummy/placeholder data. All hooks fetch real data from the configured UiPath environment.**
